        <p> <b>The Legend of Zelda</b> is a high fantasy action-adventure video game franchise created by Japanese game
            designers Shigeru Miyamoto and Takashi Tezuka. It is primarily developed and published by Nintendo, although
            some portable installments and re-releases have been outsourced to Capcom, Vanpool, and Grezzo. The gameplay
            incorporates action-adventure and elements of action RPG games.</p>
        <p>The series centers on the various incarnations of Link, a courageous young Hylian man, with pointy elf-like
            ears;
            and Princess Zelda, a magical princess that is the mortal reincarnation of the goddess Hylia; as they fight
            to
            save the magical land of Hyrule from Ganon, an evil warlord turned demon king, who is the principal
            antagonist
            of the series. Ganon wishes to use the Triforce, a sacred relic left behind by the three goddesses that
            created
            Hyrule to remake the world in his own dark image. When gathered together, the power of the Triforce can
            grant
            any wish its user desires; however, if someone with a heart that does not possess a balance of the three
            virtues
            of Power, Courage and Wisdom attempts to touch the Triforce, it will split into three triangles and bond
            with
            three people whose hearts embody the required virtue.</p>
        <p>Although their personalities and backstory differ from game to game, the incarnations of Link and Zelda often
            have many traits in common; such as Link often being left-handed and associated with the color green while
            Princess Zelda is often a member of the royal family. While the conflict with Ganon serves as a backbone for
            the
            series, some games have featured other settings and antagonists, with Link traveling or being sent to these
            other lands in their time of need.</p>
        <p>Since the original Legend of Zelda was released in 1986, the series has expanded to include 19 entries on all
            of
            Nintendo's major game consoles, as well as a number of spin-offs. An American animated TV series based on
            the
            games aired in 1989 and individual manga adaptations commissioned by Nintendo have been produced in Japan
            since
            1997. The Legend of Zelda is one of Nintendo's most prominent and successful franchises; several of its
            entries
            are considered to be among the greatest video games of all time.</p>
